# 🏛️ Landmark Legacy: NFT-Based Fractional Ownership for Landmark Preservation

Welcome to Landmark Legacy, a revolutionary Web3 platform that empowers communities to invest in and preserve historical landmarks through fractional NFT ownership. By tokenizing ownership of real-world landmarks as NFTs and fractionalizing them, users can buy shares to fund maintenance, restoration, and upgrades. This solves the real-world problem of underfunded cultural heritage sites, where governments and organizations often struggle with budgets, by crowdsourcing investments from a global community. Revenue from ticket sales, events, or partnerships is distributed back to owners, creating a sustainable funding loop.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Landmark Legacy leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts for secure, transparent operations. The system involves 8 interconnected smart contracts to handle registration, fractionalization, funding, governance, and distribution. Here's a breakdown:

### Core Smart Contracts (Written in Clarity)
1. **LandmarkRegistry**: Registers new landmarks with details like location, description, and proof of authority (e.g., from owners or governments). Ensures uniqueness and prevents duplicates.
2. **LandmarkNFT**: Mints a unique SIP-009 compliant NFT representing full ownership of the landmark. This NFT is locked in a vault for fractionalization.
3. **Fractionalizer**: Splits the LandmarkNFT into fractional shares using a SIP-010 fungible token standard. Defines total supply (e.g., 1,000,000 shares) and handles minting/burning.
4. **InvestmentPool**: Collects STX (Stacks tokens) from share purchases during crowdfunding phases. Funds are locked and released for maintenance upon milestones.
5. **GovernanceDAO**: Enables fractional share holders to propose and vote on maintenance decisions (e.g., "Restore the facade" or "Add eco-friendly lighting"). Uses weighted voting based on shares owned.
6. **RevenueDistributor**: Integrates with off-chain oracles to receive revenue data (e.g., from ticket sales) and distributes dividends proportionally to share holders.
7. **OwnershipVault**: Securely custodies the LandmarkNFT, ensuring it can't be transferred without full consensus (e.g., via DAO vote). Manages redemption if all fractions are reunited.
8. **ShareMarketplace**: A decentralized exchange for trading fractional shares. Includes royalty fees that feed back into the maintenance pool.

### For Landmark Owners/Stewards
- Submit landmark details to `LandmarkRegistry` with verifiable proof (e.g., legal documents hashed on-chain).
- Mint the `LandmarkNFT` and fractionalize it via `Fractionalizer` to create shares.
- Launch a crowdfunding campaign in `InvestmentPool` to sell initial shares and raise funds for immediate maintenance.

Your landmark now has community-backed funding!

### For Investors/Community Members
- Browse registered landmarks and buy fractional shares on the `ShareMarketplace`.
- Use shares to participate in `GovernanceDAO` votes on how funds are used.
- Receive automatic dividends through `RevenueDistributor` when the landmark generates income.

Instant ownership and impact!

### For Verifiers/Auditors
- Query `LandmarkRegistry` or `OwnershipVault` to confirm NFT status and fractional details.
- Check `InvestmentPool` for transparent fund usage and milestones.

This ensures accountability and trust in the system.
